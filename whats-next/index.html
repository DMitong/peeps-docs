            <h2>Peeps Future Features Plan: A Look Ahead</h2>
        </section>

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section>
            <h3>Introduction:<h3>
                <p>The Peeps development team is committed to continuous improvement and user satisfaction. This future features plan outlines exciting upcoming developments designed to enhance the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI), expand the in-platform gaming arcade, introduce new token types, and broaden our Decentralized Finance (DeFi) offerings.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>UI/UX Enhancements:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Personalization:</b>  Implement user-customizable themes and layouts to personalize the platform experience.
            <li><b>Advanced Search Functionality:</b>  Develop a robust search engine with filters and advanced search options for efficient content discovery.
            <li><b>Intuitive Wallet Management:</b>  Refine the in-platform wallet interface for a more user-friendly experience, including simplified token management and clear transaction history visualizations.
            <li><b>Accessibility Features:</b> Integrate accessibility features to ensure the platform is inclusive and usable for everyone. This may include text-to-speech functionality, screen reader compatibility, and high-contrast themes.
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Gaming Arcade Expansion:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Genre Diversification:</b> Broaden the game selection within the arcade by introducing new genres beyond the current offerings. This could include strategy games, puzzle games, and role-playing games (RPGs) to cater to a wider range of user preferences.
            <li><b>Social Gaming Features:</b> Implement social features within the arcade, such as leaderboards, tournaments, and co-operative gameplay options, to foster a stronger sense of community and friendly competition among users.
            <li><b>Play-to-Earn Integration:</b> Explore the potential for integrating play-to-earn mechanics into the arcade. This could involve rewarding users with tokens or NFTs for their in-game achievements, adding a new layer of engagement and potential monetization.
            </ul>
            <h3>Token & DeFi Expansion:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><b>New Token Types:</b> Introduce new token types beyond the platform's primary utility token. This could include governance tokens allowing users to participate in platform decision-making, or creator-specific tokens enabling direct fan support for individual content creators.
            <li><b>Advanced DeFi Tools:</b> Integrate more sophisticated DeFi tools within the platform's wallet. This could encompass features like staking, liquidity pools, and lending/borrowing functionalities, allowing users to earn passive income on their holdings and engage in more complex DeFi activities directly through the platform.
            <li><b>Fiat On-Ramp and Off-Ramp:</b> Develop functionalities for users to easily convert between fiat currencies (traditional government-issued money) and cryptocurrencies within the platform. This would remove barriers to entry for new users unfamiliar with cryptocurrency exchanges and make it easier for users to cash out their earnings.  (Note: Implementing fiat on-ramps and off-ramps may require regulatory considerations depending on your location).
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
            
            <p>This future features plan highlights our dedication to providing a best-in-class social media experience with a focus on security, innovation, and user-centric design. By implementing these improvements, Peeps will continue to attract and retain users, solidify its position at the forefront of social media evolution, and empower users to explore the full potential of the web3 landscape.</p>
